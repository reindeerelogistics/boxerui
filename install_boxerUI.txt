If running BoxerUI_app for the first time, you might need to install its dependencies first.
The included shell script will ensure you have the dependencies required. 
There is a likelihood you might not have execution rights.
Copy and paste this (excluding the quotes) "chmod +x Boxer_Install.sh; ./Boxer_Install.sh" in your terminal to have execution rights and run the script.

If it isn't your first time installing BoxerUI_app and you have the dependencies on your machine. 
You may run the BoxerUI_app by copy/pasting "./BoxerUI_app" in your terminal
